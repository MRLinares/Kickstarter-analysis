# Kickstarting with Excel
## Overview of Project
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to learn how campaigns fare in relation to their launch dates and funding goals.
### Purpose
To give our client analytical insight on the campaign data and how certain variables effect one another, if at all.
## Analysis and Challenges

Using Microsoft Excel, Kickstarter data was sorted by various variables including launch dates, campaign outcomes, funding goal amounts, and pledged amounts, just to name a few.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Dates

An analysis solely based on how theater campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates shows that there is a precise window in which an individual can find success in their theatrical endeavors with respect to a Kickstarter campaign.  By timing their launch date between early spring to mid summer, they can increase their odds of a successful campaign given the large spike of successful campaigns that start in this time period (shown in the chart below) and the proportion of success in relation to those that failed.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals

An analysis solely based on how theater campaigns fared in relation to their funding goals shows a direct relationship between goal amounts and success rates.  Unlike the analysis above where both success and failures spiked up in March, albeit to a much lesser extent for failures, their is a direct correlation between how high you set your goal and the chance you would find success in that bracket.  By sorting the data into intervals of five thousand dollars, it becomes evident that low goals (below $5000.00) have high rates of success for theater campaigns in relation to those that have failed. With 92% of our data coming in the range of one to fifteen thousand dollars (area within red rectangle), it becomes apparent that the higher your goal, the less likely you will find success in a theater campaign on Kickstarter.  The large interchange visible on the high side of the spectrum (red arrow) is a small sample size of nine projects.
